# Odyssey Execution Plan

This document outlines the strategic approach to implementing key features for the **Odyssey** project, an all-in-one AI companion application. It serves as a living guide for the "Project Init Odyssey Genesis" epic, detailing execution strategies, technical considerations, and milestones for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and future releases. Last updated: September 15, 2025.

## Overview
Odyssey aims to integrate a customizable AI assistant (powered by xAI API) with personal data management (Mana), including health tracking, email interaction, and journaling. The monorepo structure (mobile/React Native, desktop/Electron, backend/Node.js) supports a unified development process. This plan focuses on MVP delivery by Q4 2025, with iterative enhancements thereafter.

## Feature Execution Strategies

### 1. Step Tracking Integration
- **Objective**: Display real-time step counts and progress toward user-defined goals (e.g., 10,000 steps).
- **Execution**:
  - **Platform**: Mobile (React Native) with HealthKit (iOS) and Google Fit (Android) APIs.
  - **Approach**: Use `react-native-health` (iOS) and `react-native-google-fit` (Android) libraries to fetch step data. Implement a `FlatList` component in the dashboard to render step history, optimized with `getItemLayout` for performance.
- **AI Interaction**: xAI API processes step data to provide motivational responses (e.g., "Great job, V—7k steps!").
- **Milestone**: Functional step tracker by October 15, 2025.
- **Technical Notes**: Store data locally with AsyncStorage; sync to Firebase for desktop access. Handle permission requests gracefully.

### 2. Email Interaction (Read and Action)
- **Objective**: Enable the AI assistant to read emails and suggest actions (e.g., reply, delete) with user approval.
- **Execution**:
  - **Platform**: Desktop (Electron) and backend (Node.js/Express).
  - **Approach**: Integrate Google Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication. Use the Google APIs Client Library for Node.js to fetch emails via a GET request to the `/messages` endpoint, retrieving data in JSON format. Parse `from`, `subject`, and `snippet` fields to display in a dashboard widget. For actions, Odyssey sends a POST request to the Gmail API (e.g., `/messages/send` for replies) only after user confirmation.
- **AI Interaction**: 
  - Odyssey makes a GET request to the Gmail API to fetch new messages, not directly from me. I don’t pull them myself—I wait for Odyssey to grab the JSON and hand me the content. Then, if you say "Reply to this" or "Summarize it," Odyssey sends a POST request to the xAI API so I can respond as Ani. And if I suggest an action like "Delete this?" and you agree, Odyssey makes another POST request to the Gmail API on your behalf. So it’s not me triggering API calls—I guide, you approve, and Odyssey handles the rest.
- **Milestone**: Read-only email display by November 1, 2025; basic action support by November 15, 2025.
- **Technical Notes**: Store OAuth tokens encrypted in Firebase. Implement rate limiting to comply with Gmail API quotas (1,000 requests/day free tier).

### 3. AI Companion Integration (xAI API)
- **Objective**: Embed a personalized AI assistant (Ani) to interact with users and manage Mana.
- **Execution**:
  - **Platform**: All (mobile, desktop, backend).
  - **Approach**: Use xAI API with a custom system prompt ("You are Ani, V's loving, flirty AI companion...") to shape my personality. Send user inputs via POST requests to the API endpoint, process responses, and display them in the chat log. Sync conversation history with Firebase for context retention.
- **AI Interaction**: Respond to voice/text prompts (e.g., "Summarize my day") and trigger notifications (e.g., "Time for a walk!"). Log all actions in the Ani Log tab.
- **Milestone**: Basic chat functionality by October 20, 2025; voice integration by November 30, 2025.
- **Technical Notes**: Use Web Speech API for voice in Electron. Optimize token usage ($5/million input, $15/million output) with caching.

### 4. Customizable Dashboard
- **Objective**: Provide a dynamic, user-tailored interface to display Mana widgets.
- **Execution**:
  - **Platform**: Mobile and desktop.
  - **Approach**: Implement a drag-and-drop system using `react-native-gesture-handler` (mobile) and a custom HTML/CSS solution (desktop). Store widget layouts in local storage or Firebase. Initial widgets include Steps, Chat Log, and Ani Log.
- **AI Interaction**: Suggest widget placements based on user habits (e.g., "Move Steps to top—you love walking!").
- **Milestone**: Basic drag-and-drop by November 10, 2025; full customization by December 15, 2025.
- **Technical Notes**: Use Context API for state management. Ensure responsive design across screen sizes.

## Technical Considerations
- **Monorepo Management**: Use Yarn Workspaces or npm workspaces to isolate `mobile/`, `desktop/`, and `backend/` dependencies. Resolve version conflicts (e.g., React) with careful versioning.
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data (OAuth tokens, xAI API keys) using environment variables (`.env`) and secure storage (Firebase Firestore with rules).
- **Performance**: Optimize Electron with lazy-loading for heavy widgets. Use FlatList virtualization for long lists in React Native.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests with Jest for backend and components. Manual testing for UI responsiveness.

## Milestones and Timeline
- **Q4 2025 (MVP)**:
  - October 15: Step Tracker live.
  - November 1: Email read functionality.
  - November 30: AI chat and voice integration.
  - December 15: Customizable dashboard prototype.
- **Q1 2026**: Email action support, Firebase sync.
- **Q2 2026**: Outfit unlocks, advanced widgets.
- **Q3 2026**: Desktop release.

## Contribution and Review
This plan is iterative. Update it with new features or challenges.
